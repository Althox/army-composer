      <h4>Why use Army Composer?</h4>
      <p>There are some nice applications out there, but most of them seem to be lacking in what most might need. They are also locked behind paywalls or by weird licenses. This application is here to change all of that!</p>
      <p>This application is totally free to host and use on your own. The data is not supplied here for license purposes; but you can customize this however you want!</p>
      <p>If you want to, you can apply to help out with developing this project.</p>
