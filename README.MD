# Army Composer
A Docker project for setting up a Wargaming Armory website.

The project is built in such a way that you'll only need to run a single command (`docker compose up`) to make the site run.

The project is based off of a few different languages and frameworks. See the README for each project (found under _/backend/_ and _/frontend/_) for more information.

The structure of the site is build with the following:

**Backend**
* Server: NGINX
* Language/Framework: PHP running with Symfony
* Database: PostgreSQL

**Frontend**

This is a page hosted by Node running with React on the NextJS framework.
